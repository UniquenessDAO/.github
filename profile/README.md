## About UniquenessDAO

### Motivation

DeFi DAOs claim to have decentralized governance but have a problem of governance tokens concentrated in the hands of a developers, investors and whales.
80% of the total supply in circulation of Uniswap’s governance token UNI is held by the Uniswap team, early investors and token holders with balances of over 1 million UNI.
1% of the total token holder addresses hold around 97% of the total governance token supply.

### Vision of the project
Achieving true decentralization and plurality requires going beyond quadratic voting mechanisms by measuring the uniqueness of each voter. 
UniquenessDAO is a voting mechanism which uses machine learning to assign each voter a uniqueness score by looking at their graph of attestations (soul-bound tokens) and the voter's past voting activity.

UniquenessDAO’s quadratic voting mechanism takes into account voter uniqueness and conviction in weighing the vote.

Using the results of ML in a DAO voting mechanism means public transparency and auditability of data inputs and intermediate ML model outputs is crucial

Filecoin IPFS allows us to store the input data, intermediate ML model outputs and uniqueness score assigned to each user for each DAO proposal vote with provable authenticity for public inspection and auditability.
